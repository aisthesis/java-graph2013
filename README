java-graph2013
=============================================
Git repository for an open-source Java graph library
started 12/13/2012
This library currently includes relatively lightweight
classes that avoid the overhead involved in insuring
thread-safety.
This is a rebuilt version of java-graph2012 using templates
to keep the library as lightweight and flexible as possible.
I plan to include thread-safe classes in a later version.
