/**
 * Utility class for transposing a graph. The type parameter T specifies the type
 * of the vertices in the original graph, and the type U specifies the type
 * of vertices in the transpose graph created by the transposer object. These
 * 2 types will often be the same but do not have to be.
 * The contract of the transposer is: 
 * <ol>
 * <li>to produce a vertex of type U corresponding to each vertex in the input graph, and</li>
 * <li>to create an edge in the new graph whose tail corresponds to the head and whose
 * head corresponds to the tail of the respective edge in the input graph</li>
 * </ol>
 * No satellite data is preserved by the transpose operation. It must be set in subsequent
 * operations on the transpose graph.
